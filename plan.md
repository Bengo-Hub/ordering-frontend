# Food Delivery Frontend Delivery Plan

## Vision & Experience Principles
- Deliver a unified Urban Cafe experience across web (Next.js), PWA, and mobile clients (React Native) with localized (EN/SW) content, offline resilience, and real-time delivery visibility.
- Uphold brand palette (chocolate brown, orange, white) and accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA) while ensuring sub-second perceived performance.
- Leverage shared design tokens and component libraries to keep feature parity between customer, rider, cafe, and admin touchpoints.

## Recent Progress (November 2025)
- Unified light/dark theming with CSS variables, shadcn components, and mobile-ready navigation/headers/footers.
- Revamped public marketing surface (landing, about, contact, delivery, menu, loyalty, cafés) with customer-focused storytelling and responsive design.
- Delivered location-aware experiences: reusable Leaflet map component, Busia geofence, geolocation hooks, and customer/rider address selectors with autocomplete.
- Implemented role-based auth hub plus polished customer sign-up, rider onboarding (map pin capture), and staff portal entry points using Zustand demo auth.
- Rationalised sitemap—removed placeholder merchant docs—and refreshed contact flows, support CTAs, and CTA copy across the site.

## Upcoming Focus
- Integrate brand configuration, logo management, and copy overrides with backend admin APIs (`look_and_feel` settings).
- Persist customer/rider address books via backend location services, including reverse geocoding and Busia geofence validation on the server.
- Wire rider onboarding form to backend KYC workflow service, implementing document upload storage and verification status APIs.
- Connect merchant/staff invite flows to tenancy provisioning once backend tenancy endpoints are live.
- Expand auth flows with actual OAuth callbacks, OTP support, and session handling shared with mobile apps.
- Implement dashboard shells for merchants and riders once orders, payouts, and analytics APIs are available.
- Admin creation remains restricted: superuser provisions initial admin accounts; no public admin signup flows will be exposed.

## Tooling & Architecture
- **Frameworks:** Next.js 15 (App Router), React Native 0.74+, Expo for rapid builds, Capacitor PWA enhancements.
- **State & Data:** TanStack Query for server state, Zustand for lightweight client state, React Hook Form + Zod validation, Jotai for low-level atoms where needed.
- **Networking:** Axios via shared `baseapi` wrapper, WebSocket/SSE client for live updates, service worker API for offline sync.
- **UI System:** Tailwind CSS + Radix UI (web), NativeWind (mobile), Figma handoff tokens synced through Style Dictionary.
- **Maps & Geo:** Leaflet (web) with reusable map component and geofence logic; Mapbox/React Native Mapbox GL on mobile; fallback to Google Maps if required.
- **Internationalization:** next-intl (web) & react-native-localize + i18next (mobile), centralized copy JSON with translation pipeline.
- **Testing & Quality:** Vitest + Testing Library, Detox/E2E for mobile, Playwright for PWA, Percy visual testing.
- **Analytics:** Segment/Amplitude instrumentation, consent-aware tracking toggles.
  - Theming tokens now hydrate from CSS variables; upcoming backend sync will persist look & feel per tenant.
  - _Backend alignment: Observability & analytics hooks tie into [Cross-Cutting Concerns – Observability](../food-delivery-backend/plan.md#cross-cutting-concerns)._

## Cross-Cutting Concerns
- **Offline & Performance:** service worker caching strategies (App Shell, stale-while-revalidate), background sync for failed actions, skeleton loading states, Lighthouse score targets (Performance 90+, PWA badge).
- **Accessibility:** Semantic components, keyboard navigation, color contrast validation (axe), accessible map alternatives.
- **Security & Privacy:** Secure storage (expo-secure-store), CSRF protection, input sanitization, session renewal flows, telemetry anonymization.
- **Dev Experience:** Monorepo with Turborepo, Storybook for design review, linting (ESLint, Stylelint), Prettier config, Husky pre-commit hooks.
- **Responsive & PWA-Ready:** Every page, including admin and driver flows, must be responsive (mobile, tablet, desktop) with installable PWA support so users can run the experience without separate native builds.

## Integration Points
- **Backend APIs:** Strict contract via OpenAPI, shared TypeScript types (tRPC or openapi-typescript) to avoid drift.
- **`notifications-app`:** Subscription management UI, template preview, user channel preferences, and consumption of notification delivery receipts for in-app status chips.
- **`treasury-app`:** Payment status polling, rider/cafe wallet balances, payout visibility, and surface of treasury settlement timelines inside the operations dashboards.
- **Push Providers:** Firebase Cloud Messaging for Android/web, Apple Push Notifications, plus SMS fallback toggles.
  - _Backend alignment: See [External Integrations & Dependencies](../food-delivery-backend/plan.md#external-integrations--dependencies) in the backend plan._

## Known Gaps
- Forms currently simulate submissions; backend endpoints for KYC, tenant provisioning, and OAuth callbacks are required.
- Staff portal authentication awaits invitation token verification API and session management.
- Rider and merchant dashboards will ship after orders, payouts, and analytics APIs are available.

## Backlog & Enhancements
- AI-driven recommendations & upsell banners, live chat support widget, referral programs, queue-based loyalty rewards, white-label theming for multi-brand expansion.
- Advanced rider route optimization, shift bidding, tip management, micro-interactions for user delight.

---
**Next Steps:** Align with backend on contract-first API specs, finalize component library scope, and lock UX milestones with stakeholders.

## Runtime Ports & Environments
- **Local development:** consume backend at `http://localhost:4000`, treasury at `http://localhost:4001`, and notifications at `http://localhost:4002` when running services locally.
- **Cloud deployment:** all backend ingress endpoints terminate on port **4000**, so the frontend uses public DNS (e.g. `https://fooddeliveryapi.codevertexitsolutions.com`) without port suffixes.
